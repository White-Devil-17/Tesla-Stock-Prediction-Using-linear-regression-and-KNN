# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-Using-linear-regression-and-KNN
This project predicts the future price of Tesla stock using linear regression and K-nearest neighbors.

Data:
The data used for this project is the daily closing price of Tesla stock from 2010-2017.

Models:
Two models were used for this project: linear regression and K-nearest neighbors.

->Linear regression is a simple model that predicts the future price of Tesla stock based on its historical price.
->K-nearest neighbors is a more complex model that predicts the future price of Tesla stock based on the prices of its closest neighbors in the historical data.

Results:
The results of the two models were compared. Linear regression was found to be more accurate than K-nearest neighbors.

Conclusion:
->This project demonstrates how linear regression and K-nearest neighbors can be used to predict the future price of Tesla stock. The results of the project suggest that linear regression is a more accurate model than K-nearest neighbors.
